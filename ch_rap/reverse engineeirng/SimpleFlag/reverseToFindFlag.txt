DESCRIPTION : 
You have been provided with a binary executable file, flaghunter.exe. The objective of this challenge is to reverse-engineer the binary to find the hidden flag
Upon running the binary, 
it doesnâ€™t display any meaningful output or instructions; however, 
there are suspicious parts of the program that suggest a hidden flag is embedded somewhere 
inside. You will need to explore the binary, 
understand how it operates, and extract the flag from it


HINT : check for embedded strings using tools like strings on Linux or through a disassembler. Often, flags are hidden in plain sight within the binary
File : getFlag.exe

SOLUTION : 
	flag : RS{c2luamFiX2hpZGRlbl9mbGFn}

POINT : 100
